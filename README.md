# Low-Latency Coding Repository

This repository is a **personal playground for low-latency programming and experiments**.  

Here, I will practice and implement various low-level and high-performance programming concepts, including:  
- Ring buffers, queues, and concurrent data structures  
- High-performance messaging systems (e.g., Aeron, LMAX Disruptor)  
- Networking optimizations (e.g., DPDK, zero-copy techniques)  
- Consistency and concurrency patterns  
- Any other coding exercises I encounter in interviews or real-world scenarios  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to **document practical implementations** and **personal experiments** with low-latency technologies.  
It serves as a **reference for my own learning** and can also help others who are exploring low-latency programming.  

## How to Use
- Each program or experiment is placed in its own folder with clear naming.  
- Simple code examples, experiments, and tests will be stored here.  
- This repository is intentionally kept **simple and generic** â€” no detailed conceptual content.  
- Users can clone and explore examples to understand **high-performance coding patterns**.  

## Notes
- This repository is a **work-in-progress** and will evolve as I learn and implement more low-latency techniques.  
- Focus is on **practical coding**, not theory.
